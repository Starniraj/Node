Node.js

It is launched on 2014 by Ryan Dahl.
It is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser.
NodeJS is not a framework and it’s not a programming language.
Node js is the server side of js
It helps to run js on our OS directly
We often use Node.js for building back-end services like APIs like Web App or Mobile App.
It’s used in production by large companies such as Paypal, Uber, Netflix, Walmart, and so on.
Features of NodeJS:

It’s easy to get started and can be used for prototyping and agile development
It provides fast and highly scalable services
It uses JavaScript everywhere, so it’s easy for a JavaScript programmer to build back-end services using Node.js
Source code cleaner and consistent.
Large ecosystem for open source library.
It has Asynchronous or Non-blocking nature.
Advantages of NodeJS: Here are the benefits of using Node.js

Easy Scalability: Developers prefer to use Node.js because it is easily scaling the application in both horizontal and vertical directions.

Real-time web apps: If you are building a web app you can also use PHP, and it will take the same amount of time when you use Node.js, But if I am talking about building chat apps or gaming apps Node.js is much more preferable because of faster synchronization. Also, the event loop avoids HTTP overloaded for Node.js development.

Fast Suite: NodeJs runs on the V8 engine developed by Google. Event loop in NodeJs handles all asynchronous operation so NodeJs acts like a fast suite and all the operations can be done quickly like reading or writing in the database, network connection, or file system

Easy to learn and code: NodeJs is easy to learn and code because it uses JavaScript. If you are a front-end developer and have a good grasp of JavaScript you can easily learn and build the application on NodeJS

Application of NodeJS:

Real-Time Chats, Complex Single-Page applications, Real-time collaboration tools, Streaming apps JSON APIs based application
